## Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience (Walmart/TheForage)

This repository showcases my solutions for the Walmart Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program, offered through TheForage platform.  The program provided hands-on experience across various software engineering disciplines.

## Project Overview

This program challenged participants to solve real-world problems encompassing several key areas of advanced software engineering. My solutions are organized by task:

* **Advanced Data Structures:**  *(Brief, high-level description of the task and your approach, e.g., "Implemented a solution for [specific problem] using [data structure] to achieve [performance benefit]."  Avoid detailed code explanations here.)*

* **Software Architecture:** *(Brief description of your architectural design choices and rationale.)*

* **Relational Database Design:** *(Summary of your database schema, including key tables and relationships.  Consider including an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) if appropriate.)*

* **Data Munging:** *(Summary of the data cleaning and transformation techniques employed.)*

## Task List

Below is a list of tasks and challenges included in this virtual experience program:

1. Task 1: Advanced Data Structures

2. Task 2: Software Architecture

3. Task 3: Relational Database Design

4. Task 4: Data Munging
